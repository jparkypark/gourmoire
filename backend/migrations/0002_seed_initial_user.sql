-- Migration: Seed initial user data
-- Date: 2024-06-23
-- Description: Insert the hardcoded user account with hashed password
-- Note: This is a placeholder - actual seeding will be done programmatically

-- The actual user insertion will be handled by the seedInitialUser function
-- because we need bcrypt to hash the password properly.
-- This file serves as documentation of the seeding process.
